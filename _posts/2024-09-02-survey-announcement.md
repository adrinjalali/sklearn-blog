We are excited to announce the launch of the scikit-learn user survey! Scikit-learn
continues to evolve thanks to contributions from its diverse user community. As we plan
for future releases, we want to ensure we are focusing on what matters most to you — our
users.

The goal of this survey is to better understand how users interact with the library,
identify any pain points, learn about the features you find most useful, and what’s
missing. This is your chance to have a say in how the library grows and adapts to meet
the evolving needs of the machine learning community.

The survey will take about 15 minutes of your time. It is available in Arabic, French,
English, Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, and Portuguese. You have the option to remain
completely anonymous, and the data collected will be used solely for the purpose of
improving scikit-learn.

This user survey is a truly collaborative effort. We would like to thank the teams from
probabl, University of Oxford (UK), and POSSEE OpenTeams, as well as many scikit-learn
contributors, for their time and effort in designing and translating it.

Once the survey closes, we’ll analyze the responses and publish the findings in a
follow-up blog post.

To take the survey, visit: 
[https://forms.gle/p5P7AweCJCbFMzfo6](https://forms.gle/p5P7AweCJCbFMzfo6). 
The survey will remain open until October 14th, 2024, and we encourage you to share it with your 
colleagues and extended network.

We value every contribution in our community, and we’re committed to making scikit-learn
even better. Your feedback is the foundation upon which scikit-learn will continue to
grow and evolve. We look forward to hearing from you!
